\section{Feasibility of optimal alignment}

There is a fundamental trade-off between perforamance and optimality guarantees:
an algorithm which is allowed to be suboptimal may exploit the lesser
restrictions for greater performance. Especially given the worst-case analysis
requiring near-quadratic runtime even to compute edit distance exactly, it is
understandable why most scholars are skeptical about faster optimal algorithms.
With our \A approach  offers a to exploits another dimensions: average case or expected case analysis.

In the direction of global alignment, optimal algorithms are commonly used in
practice, despite of their quadratic scaling. The ongoing competition between
the optimal aligners employs both algorithmic advancements and implementation
optimizations on caching, bit-parallelization, GPU.~(\cref{ch:global}).

For semi-global alignment (read mapping), common believe is that optimal
algorithms are infeasible for read mapping, especially when reads are long. All
production read mappers following the approximate seed-extend
paradigm~\cite{alser2021technology}\footnote{This study examines 107 aligners.}.
