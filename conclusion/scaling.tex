\section{Scaling analysis}

Our heuristic functions are not consistent (TODO: define), thus the same state
could be expanded more than once. Formally speaking, this implies that the worst
case asymptotics could explode.

In practice we employ a best-fit estimation of the scaling which is not
asymptotic.
