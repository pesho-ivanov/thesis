\section{Trade-off between optimality and performance}

There is a fundamental trade-off between perforamance and optimality guarantees:
an algorithm which is allowed to be suboptimal may exploit the lesser
restrictions for greater performance. Especially given the worst-case analysis
requiring near-quadratic runtime even to compute edit distance exactly, it is
understandable why most scholars are skeptical about faster optimal algorithms.
With our \A approach  offers a to exploits another dimensions: average case or expected case analysis.

In the direction of global alignment, optimal algorithms are commonly used in
practice, despite of their quadratic scaling. The ongoing competition between
the optimal aligners employs both algorithmic advancements and implementation
optimizations on caching, bit-parallelization, GPU.~(\cref{ch:global}).

For semi-global alignment (read mapping), common believe is that optimal
algorithms are infeasible for read mapping, especially when reads are long. All
production read mappers following the approximate seed-extend
paradigm~\cite[including 107 aligners]{alser2021technology}.

\section{On pangenomics}

The non-linear structure are additional dimensions of data complexity. And
another challenge for the scalability which is good.

An algorithm without an objective function may be wrong because they do not
solve the correct problem. or because they 

In this thesis we were optimizing edit distance. 

Algorithms that guarantee correctness can be wrong only by being given a wrong problem.

An approximate algorithm can be wrong either because it did not fullfill its
mathematical goal. reach its solve the problem because of either optimizing the \emph{wrong}
function.

Algorithm correctness is arguably a useful property which is often not simple to
guarantee. It can undoubtedly improve accuracy, especially in the case of
complex data, but still be wrong from biological point of view. This is because
of  This Nevertheless, since biology is a natural science, its  optimality
guarantees must have an additional impact on the development of the field. It
not only but allows to enjoy being wrong rather than vague. Moreove, often
problems in computational biology are ill-stated andalgorithms that approximate
algorithms that. But many algorithms in computational biology do not even have a
formal statement
