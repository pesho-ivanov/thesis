\para{Fast backward reachability algorithm}
In three steps of increasing graph complexity: linear graph, DAG, and cyclic.

To add crumbs on nodes, a set of nodes that can reach seed match $m$ within a
specified number of steps has to be identified. Computationally problematic is
that the number of walks leading to seed match $m$ can grow exponentially with
walk length. This is why we apply a fast $O(R^m_{\le d_\mli{max}})$ algorithm to
compute the set of nodes $R^m_{[d_\mli{min}, d_\mli{max}]}$ that can reach the
seed match in distance $d \in [d_\mli{min}, d_\mli{max}]$. This algorithm may
include nodes that cannot reach $s$ for less than $d \in [d_\mli{min},
d_\mli{max}]$ steps (\eg for linear references it does not find additional
nodes).

All nodes that can potentially reach to the seed match $m$ will be stored in set
$\overline{R} \equiv \overline{R^m}_{[d_\mli{min},d_\mli{max}]}$. First, using
BFS, a all nodes $R^m_{\le d_\mli{max}}$ are found. Second, all cycles in the
subgraph of $\RG$ consisting solely of nodes from $R^m_{\le d_\mli{max}}$ are
added to $\overline{R}$. Third, all nodes from
$\overline{R^m}_{[d_\mli{min},d_\mli{max}]}$ that reach a cycle node is added to
$\overline{R}$. Fourth, let $\mli{maxDist^s}(u)$ is the maximum possible
distance from node $u$ to seed match $s$, if defined. For each node $u$ in the
DAG between (possibly) the cycles and the seed match, $\mli{maxDist}^s(u)$ is
defined and can be computed as:
\begin{align}
\mli{maxDist}^s(u) = 
    \begin{cases} 
        \max_{(u,v) \in \RGE}{\mli{maxDist}^s(v)} & u \neq \mli{startNode}(m) \\
        0 & \mli{else}
    \end{cases}
\end{align}.

Let $\mli{minHigherCost}(\mli{cost})$ is a lower bound of the next best cost for
matching a seed elsewhere if it can be matched for $\mli{cost}$:
\begin{align}
\mli{minHigherCost}(\mli{cost}) &= \min_{a, b, c, d \ge 0} \{ a\cmatch + b\csubst + c\cins + d\cdel > \mli{cost} \}
\end{align}

Let a \textit{radius} $r(s) \ge 0$ be a predefined value associated with each
seed \mbox{$s \in S$} that signifies the maximal cost for which $s$ is matched
across $\RG$.

%    \Large[ \mli{minHigherCost}(r(s)) - \mli{minMatchCost}(u,s,j-i) \Large]
In the simpler case of $r(s) \equiv 0$,
%$\implies \mli{minHigherCost(r(s))} \equiv 1$
the seeds are matched exactly (without mistakes) to the reference graph.
% and any not matched seed adds a cost of $1$ to $h$.
