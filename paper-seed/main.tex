\chapter{Scaling with query length} \label{ch:seed}

\graphicspath{{\dir/}}

In this chapter we consider the same problem of semi-global alignment of a set
of reads to a general graph reference. The trie index from~\cref{ch:trie}
enables sublinear scaling with the reference size but each additional error
triggers a deeper exploration of the trie, leading to exponential scaling. Now
we equip the \A algorithm with a superior \sh that is informed by substrings
from the whole query length. This enables near-linear scaling with the error
rate (as opposed the exponential scaling in~\cref{ch:trie}), thus scaling to
long reads with orders of magnitude of speedup compared to other optimal
algorithms.
