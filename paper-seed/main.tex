\chapter{Scaling with query length} \label{ch:seed}

\graphicspath{{\dir/}}

In this chapter we consider the same problem of semi-global alignment of a set
of reads to a general graph reference. The main advantage of our approach is
that it uses a trie index, allowing sublinear scaling of the alignment time with
the reference size. Even for moderate size references, this results in orders of
magnitude of speedup compared to other optimal algorithms.
