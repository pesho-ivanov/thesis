\section{Seed heuristic} \label{sec:seed_heuristic}
%
We instantiate the \A algorithm with a novel, domain-specific \textit{\seedh}
which allows to quickly align reads to a general reference graph.
%
We first intuitively explain the seed heuristic and showcase it on a simple
example (\cref{sec:overview}). Then, we formally define the heuristic and prove
its admissibility (\cref{sec:definition}).
%
Finally, we adapt our approach to rely on a trie, which leads to a critical
speedup (\cref{sec:trie}).
