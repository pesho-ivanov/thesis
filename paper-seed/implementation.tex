\subsection{Implementation}

Both the \seedh and the \prefixh reuse the same free and open source C++
codebase of our \astarix aligner: \astarixurl. It includes a simple
implementation of a graph and trie data structure which is not optimized for
memory usage. In order to easily align reverse complement reads, the reverse
complement of the graph is stored alongside its straight version. The shortest
path algorithm only constructs explored states explicitly, so most states remain
implicitly defined and do not cause computational burden.

Both heuristics benefit from a default optimization in \astarix we call
\emph{greedy matching} (also known as \emph{sliding}) which skips adding a state
to the \A~queue when only one edge is outgoing from a state and the upcoming
read and reference letters match.
