            Ensembl Genomes (http://www.ensemblgenomes.org) is an integrating
            resource for genome-scale data from non-vertebrate species,
            complementing the resources for vertebrate genomics developed in the
            context of the Ensembl project (http://www.ensembl.org). Together,
            the two resources provide a consistent set of interfaces to genomic
            data across the tree of life, including reference genome sequence,
            gene models, transcriptional data, genetic variation and comparative
            analysis. Data may be accessed via our website, online tools
            platform and programmatic interfaces, with updates made four times
            per year (in synchrony with Ensembl). Here, we provide an overview
            of Ensembl Genomes, with a focus on recent developments. These
            include the continued growth, more robust and reproducible sets of
            orthologues and paralogues, and enriched views of gene expression
            and gene function in plants. Finally, we report on our continued
            deeper integration with the Ensembl project, which forms a key part
            of our future strategy for dealing with the increasing quantity of
            available genome-scale data across the tree of life.},

	abstract = {Aligning DNA sequences to an annotated reference is a key step for genotyping in biology. Recent scientific studies have demonstrated improved inference by aligning reads to a variation graph, i.e., a reference sequence augmented with known genetic variations. Given a variation graph in the form of a directed acyclic string graph, the sequence to graph alignment problem seeks to find the best matching path in the graph for an input query sequence. Solving this problem exactly using a sequential dynamic programming algorithm takes quadratic time in terms of the graph size and query length, making it difficult to scale to high throughput DNA sequencing data. In this work, we propose the first parallel algorithm for computing sequence to graph alignments that leverages multiple cores and single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. We take advantage of the available inter-task parallelism, and provide a novel blocked approach to compute the score matrix while ensuring high memory locality. Using a 48-core Intel Xeon Skylake processor, the proposed algorithm achieves peak performance of 317 billion cell updates per second (GCUPS), and demonstrates near linear weak and strong scaling on up to 48 cores. It delivers significant performance gains compared to existing algorithms, and results in run-time reduction from multiple days to three hours for the problem of optimally aligning high coverage long (PacBio/ONT) or short (Illumina) DNA reads to an MHC human variation graph containing 10 million vertices.},

	abstract = {Graphs are commonly used to represent sets of sequences. Either edges or nodes can be labeled by sequences, so that each path in the graph spells a concatenated sequence. Examples include graphs to represent genome assemblies, such as string graphs and de Bruijn graphs, and graphs to represent a pan-genome and hence the genetic variation present in a population. Being able to align sequencing reads to such graphs is a key step for many analyses and its applications include genome assembly, read error correction, and variant calling with respect to a variation graph. Given the wide range of applications of this basic problem, it is surprising that algorithms with optimal runtime are, to the best of our knowledge, yet unknown. In particular, aligning sequences to cyclic graphs currently represents a challenge both in theory and practice. Here, we introduce an algorithm to compute the minimum edit distance of a sequence of length
            m
            to any path in a node-labeled directed graph (

	abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals., Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10–20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package., Availability: http://maq.sourceforge.net, Contact: rd@sanger.ac.uk},
