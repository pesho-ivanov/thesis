		A toy illustration of the \sh precomputation before aligning a read
		$q$ to a reference graph $\RG$. The read is split into four colored
		seeds, where their corresponding crumbs are shown inside reference graph
		nodes as symbols with matching color. The optimal alignment is
		highlighted as a green path ending with a tick (\protect\greentick{})
		and includes one
		substitution~($\mathtt{\textcolor{dark-red}{T}{\rightarrow}\textcolor{dark-red}{A}}$)
		and one deletion~($\textcolor{dark-red}{\mathtt{C}}$).
