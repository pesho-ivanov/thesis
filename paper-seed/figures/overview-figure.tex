		A toy overview example using the \seedh to align a read $q$ to a
		reference graph $\RG$. The read is split into four colored seeds, where
		their corresponding crumbs are shown inside reference graph nodes as
		symbols with matching color. The optimal alignment is highlighted as a
		green path ending with a tick (\protect\greentick{}) and includes one
		substitution
		($\mathtt{\textcolor{dark-red}{T}{\rightarrow}\textcolor{dark-red}{A}}$)
		and one deletion ($\textcolor{dark-red}{\mathtt{C}}$).
