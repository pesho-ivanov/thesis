\section{Evaluations} \label{SEEDsec:eval}

\begin{samepage}
	In the following, we demonstrate that our approach aligns faster than existing
	optimal aligners due to its superior scaling. Specifically, we address the
	following research questions:
	\begin{enumerate}[label={\bfseries Q\arabic*},nolistsep,leftmargin=15mm]
		\item What speedup can the \sh achieve?
		\item How does the \sh scale with reference size?
		\item How does the \sh scale with read length?
	\end{enumerate}
	The modes of operation which we analyze include both short (Illumina) and long
	(HiFi) reads to be aligned on on both linear and graph references.
