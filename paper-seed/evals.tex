\section{Evaluations} \label{sec:eval}

In the following, we demonstrate that our approach aligns faster than existing
optimal aligners due to its superior scaling. Specifically, we address the
following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}[label={\bf Q\arabic*},nolistsep,leftmargin=15mm]
	\item What speedup can the \seedh achieve?
    \item How does the \seedh scale with reference size?
	\item How does the \seedh scale with read length?
\end{enumerate}
The modes of operation which we analyze include both short (Illumina) and long
(HiFi) reads to be aligned on on both linear and graph references.
