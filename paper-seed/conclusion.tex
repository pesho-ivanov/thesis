We thank the anonymous reviewers for the valuable feedback. The first author is
grateful for the Vipassana meditation which inspired the idea to punish paths
for the absence of foreseeable seed matches. We also thank Paul Medvedev and
Ragnar Groot Koerkamp for noting inaccuracies in the presentation of the
algorithm.

\section{Conclusion}
%
We have presented an optimal read aligner based on the \A~algorithm instantiated
with a novel \seedh which guides the search by preferring crumbs on nodes that lead
towards optimal alignments even for long reads.

The memory usage is currently limiting the application of \astarix for bigger
references due to the size of the trie index. A remaining challenge is designing
a heuristic function able to handle not only long but also noisier reads, such
as the uncorrected PacBio reads that may reach 20\% of mistakes. Possible
improvements of the seed heuristic may include inexact matching of seeds,
careful choice of seed positions, and accounting for the seeds order.
