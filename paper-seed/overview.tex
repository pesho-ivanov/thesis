\section{Overview}

\paragraph{Contributions}
Here we address the key challenge of scaling to long HiFi reads, while retaining
the superior scaling of \astarix in the size of the reference graph. To this
end, we instantiate the \A algorithm with a novel \seedh, which outperforms
existing optimal aligners on both short and long HiFi reads. Specifically, the
\seedh utilizes information from the whole read to narrowly direct the \A search
by placing \emph{crumbs} on graph nodes which lead up to a \emph{seed match},
\ie, an exact match of a substring of the read.

Overall, the contributions presented in this chapter include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel \A~\seedh that exploits information from the whole read to
    quickly align it to a general graphs reference.
    \item An optimality proof showing that the \seedh always finds an alignment
    with minimal edit distance.
	\item An implementation of the \seedh as part of the \astarix aligner.
    \item An extensive evaluation of our approach, showing that we align both
    short Illumina reads and long HiFi reads to both linear and graph references
    $\geq 60 \times$ faster than existing optimal aligners.
    \item A demonstration of superior empirical runtime scaling in the reference
    size~$N$: $N^{0.46}$ on Illumina reads and $N^{0.11}$ on HiFi reads.
\end{enumerate}
