\section{Overview}

\paragraph{Contributions}
Here we address the key challenge of scaling to long HiFi reads, while retaining
the superior scaling of \astarix in the size of the reference graph. To this
end, we instantiate the \A algorithm with a novel \sh, which outperforms
existing optimal aligners on both short and long HiFi reads. Specifically, the
\sh utilizes information from the whole read to narrowly direct the \A search
by placing \emph{crumbs} on graph nodes which lead up to a \emph{seed match},
\ie, an exact match of a substring of the read.

We present a novel \A \emph{\sh} that enables fast and optimal
sequence-to-graph alignment, guaranteed to minimize the edit distance of the
alignment assuming non-negative edit costs.

We phrase optimal alignment as a shortest path problem and solve it by
instantiating the \A~algorithm with our \sh. The \sh first extracts
non-overlapping substrings (\emph{seeds}) from the read, finds exact seed
\emph{matches} in the reference, marks preceding reference positions by
\emph{crumbs}, and uses the crumbs to direct the \A search. The key idea is to
punish paths for the absence of foreseeable seed matches. We prove admissibility
of the \sh, thus guaranteeing alignment optimality.

Our implementation extends the free and open source aligner and demonstrates
that the \sh outperforms all state-of-the-art optimal aligners including
\graphaligner, \vargas, \pasgal, and the \prefixh previously employed by
\astarix. Specifically, we achieve a consistent speedup of >60$\times$ on both
short Illumina reads and long HiFi reads (up to 25kbp, 0.3\% error rate), on
both the \textit{E.~coli} linear reference genome (1Mbp) and the MHC variant
graph (5Mbp). Our speedup is enabled by the \sh consistently skipping
>99.99\% of the table cells that optimal aligners based on dynamic programming
compute.

Overall, the contributions presented in this chapter include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel \A~\sh that exploits information from the whole read to
    quickly align it to a general graphs reference.
    \item An optimality proof showing that the \sh always finds an alignment
    with minimal edit distance.
	\item An implementation of the \sh as part of the \astarix aligner.
    \item An extensive evaluation of our approach, showing that we align both
    short Illumina reads and long HiFi reads to both linear and graph references
    $\geq 60 \times$ faster than existing optimal aligners.
    \item A demonstration of superior empirical runtime scaling in the reference
    size~$N$: $N^{0.46}$ on Illumina reads and $N^{0.11}$ on HiFi reads.
\end{enumerate}
