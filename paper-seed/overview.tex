\section{Overview}

We present a novel \A \emph{\seedh} that enables fast and optimal
sequence-to-graph alignment, guaranteed to minimize the edit distance of the
alignment assuming non-negative edit costs.

We phrase optimal alignment as a shortest path problem and solve it by
instantiating the \A~algorithm with our \seedh. The \seedh first extracts
non-overlapping substrings (\emph{seeds}) from the read, finds exact seed
\emph{matches} in the reference, marks preceding reference positions by
\emph{crumbs}, and uses the crumbs to direct the \A search. The key idea is to
punish paths for the absence of foreseeable seed matches. We prove admissibility
of the \seedh, thus guaranteeing alignment optimality.

\qquad Our implementation extends the free and open source aligner and
demonstrates that the \seedh outperforms all state-of-the-art optimal aligners
including \graphaligner, \vargas, \pasgal, and the \prefixh previously employed
by \astarix. Specifically, we achieve a consistent speedup of >60$\times$ on
both short Illumina reads and long HiFi reads (up to 25kbp), on both the
\textit{E.~coli} linear reference genome (1Mbp) and the MHC variant graph
(5Mbp). Our speedup is enabled by the \seedh consistently skipping >99.99\% of
the table cells that optimal aligners based on dynamic programming
compute.\\

\paragraph{Contributions}
%
Here we address the key challenge of scaling to long HiFi reads, while
retaining the superior scaling of \astarix in the size of the reference graph.
%
To this end, we instantiate the \A algorithm with a novel \seedh, which
outperforms existing optimal aligners on both short and long HiFi reads.
%
Specifically, the \seedh utilizes information from the whole read to narrowly
direct the \A search by placing \emph{crumbs} on graph nodes which lead up to a
\emph{seed match}, \ie, an exact match of a substring of the read.

Overall, the contributions presented in this chapter include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel \A~\seedh that exploits information from the whole read to
    quickly align it to a general graphs reference.
    \item An optimality proof showing that the \seedh always finds an alignment
    with minimal edit distance.
	\item An implementation of the \seedh as part of the \astarix aligner.
    \item An extensive evaluation of our approach, showing that we align both
    short Illumina reads and long HiFi reads to both linear and graph references
    $\geq 60 \times$ faster than existing optimal aligners.
    \item A demonstration of superior empirical runtime scaling in the reference
    size $N$: $N^{0.46}$ on Illumina reads and $N^{0.11}$ on HiFi reads.
\end{enumerate}
