\section*{Limitations}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\numberline{}Limitations}

Our presented method has several limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Complex regions trigger quadratic search.} Since it is unlikely
        that edit distance in general could be solved in strongly subquadratic
        time, it is inevitable that for some inputs our approach will require
        quadratic time. In particular, regions with high error rates, long
        indels, and too many matches are challenging and trigger quadratic
        exploration.
  \item \emph{High constant in runtime complexity.} Despite the near-linear
        scaling of the number of expanded states, \astarpa only outperforms
        \edlib and \wfa for sufficiently long sequences due to the relatively
        high computational constant that the \A search induces.
  \item \emph{Complex parameter tuning.} The performance of our approach depends
        heavily on the sequences to be aligned and the corresponding choice of
        parameters (whether to use chaining, the seed length $k$, and whether to
        use inexact matches $\spot$). The parameter tuning (currently very
        simple may require a more comprehensive framework when introducing
        additional optimizations.
  \item \emph{Consistency.} The seed heuristic, which is at the core of our \A
        algorithm, is admissible (optimistic) but not consistent (not monotone).
        As a consequence, any of the quadratic number of states can be expanded
        multiple times, which could theoretically lead to over-quadratic
        scaling. In practice, repeated expansions happen but the empirical
        scaling is preserved near-linear as long as the number of seed matches
        is near-linear and the seed heuristic is capable of compensating for the
        errors.
\end{enumerate}
