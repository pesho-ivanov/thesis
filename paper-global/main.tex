\chapter{Scaling with error rate} \label{ch:global}

\graphicspath{{\dir/}}

The trie index from \cref{ch:trie} enabled sublinear scaling with the reference
size, and the seed heuristic from \cref{ch:seed} additionally enabled long
queries to be aligned. Nevertheless, when there are too many errors (more than
1\% for long sequences), the seed heuristic may not be able to compensate for
all of them, and the search has to start exporing in width (similar to
Dijkstra).

In this chapter we consider the more basic problem of global alignment between
two sequences and demonstrate how to squeeze out more information from each seed
by aligning it inexactly (with up to 1 edit), as well as from the connection
between the seeds by chaining them in order in both sequences. As a result, we
reach near-linear scaling to long sequence for error rates as high as $15\%$ and
orders of magnitude of speedup compared to other optimal aligners for $5\%$
error rate. 

This chapter is based on a work with joint first-authorship. The contributions
of Pesho Ivnaov predominantly include the general seed heuristic with chaining,
gaps and inexact matches, while the contributions of Ragnar Groot Koerkamp
predominantly include match pruning, contours, DT, implementation, evaluations,
and proofs.
