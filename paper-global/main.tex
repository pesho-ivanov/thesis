\chapter{Scaling with error rate} \label{ch:global}

\graphicspath{{\dir/}}

The trie index (\cref{ch:trie}) enabled sublinear scaling with the reference
size, and the seed heuristic (\cref{ch:seed}) additionally enabled long queries
to be aligned. Nevertheless, when there are too many errors (more than 1\% for
long sequences), the seed heuristic may not be able to compensate for all of
them, and the search has to start exporing in width (similar to Dijkstra).

In this chapter we consider the more basic problem of global alignment between
two sequences and demonstrate how to squeeze out more information from each seed
by aligning it inexactly (with up to 1 edit), as well as from the connection
between the seeds by chaining them in order in both sequences. As a result, we
reach near-linear scaling to long sequence for error rates as high as $15\%$ and
orders of magnitude of speedup compared to other optimal aligners for $5\%$
error rate.
