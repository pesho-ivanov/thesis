\paragraph{Modes: Near-linear and quadratic}

The \A algorithm with a \sh has two modes of operation that we call
\emph{near-linear} and \emph{quadratic}. In the near-linear mode \astarpa expands few
nodes because the heuristic successfully penalizes all edits
between the sequences. Every edit that is not penalized by the heuristic widens
the explored band, leading to the quadratic mode similar to~\dijkstra.
