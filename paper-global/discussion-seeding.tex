\paragraph{Seeds are necessary, matches are optional}\label{sec:seeding}

Unlike the seed-and-extend paradigm which reconstructs good alignments by
connecting seed matches, we use the lack of matches to penalize alignments.
Given the admissibility of our heuristics, the more seeds without matches, the
higher the penalty for alignments and the easier it is to dismiss suboptimal
ones. In the extreme, not having any matches can be sufficient for finding an
optimal alignment in linear time~(\cref{app:no-matches}).
