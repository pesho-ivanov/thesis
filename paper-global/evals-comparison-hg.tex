\subsection{Comparison on human data} \label{GLOBALsec:evals-comparison-hg}

We compare runtime~(\cref{fig:human-summary} and~\cref{app:human}), and memory
usage (\cref{app:memory}) on human data.
%
We configure \astarpa to prune matches only when expanding their start (not
their end), leaving some matches on the optimal path unpruned and speeding up
the contour updates.
%
\astarpa~(\GCH with DT) aligns ONT reads faster than \edlib and \wfa in all
quartiles, being ${>}2\times$ faster in median. However, the heuristic does not predict all errors
when $d{\geq}10\%$, causing $6$~alignments to time out.
%
With genetic variation, \astarpa is $1.4\times$ faster than \edlib and \wfa in
median. Low-divergence alignments are faster than \edlib, while
high-divergence alignments are slower~($3$ sequences with $d{\geq}10\%$ time out) because of expanding
quadratically many states in complex regions~(\cref{app:complex-cases}). Since slow alignments
dominate the total runtime, \edlib is faster on average.
