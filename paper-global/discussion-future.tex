\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Performance.} The runtime could be improved by variable seed
        lengths, overlapping seeds, more aggressive pruning, and better
        parameter tuning. Implementation optimizations may include computational
        domains~\citep{spouge1989speeding}, block
        computations~\citep{liu21block}, SIMD (similar to~\wfa), or
        bit-parallelization~\citep{myers1999fast} (similar to~\edlib).
    \item \emph{Generalizations.} Our chaining seed heuristic could be
        generalized to non-unit and affine costs, and to semi-global alignment.
        Cost models that better correspond to the data can speed up the
        alignment.
    \item \emph{Relaxations.} At the expense of optimality guarantees,
        inadmissible heuristics could speed up \A considerably. Another possible
        relaxation would be to validate the optimality of a given alignment
        instead of computing it from scratch.
    \item \emph{Analysis.} The near-linear scaling of \A is not asymptotic and
        requires a more thorough theoretical
        analysis~\citep{medvedev2022limitations}.
