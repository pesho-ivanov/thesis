\subsection{Match pruning} \label{sec:pruning}

In order to reduce the number of states expanded by the \A~algorithm, we apply
the \emph{multiple-path pruning} observation: once a shortest path to a state
has been found, no other path to this state could possibly improve the global
shortest path~\citep{poole2017artificial}. As soon as \A~expands the start or
end of a match, we \emph{prune} it, so that the heuristic in preceding states no
longer benefits from the match, and they get deprioritized by \A. We define
\emph{pruned} variants of all our heuristics that ignore pruned matches:

\begin{definition}[Pruning heuristic]
   Let $\Expanded$ be the set of expanded states during the \A~search, and let
   $\prunedmatches$ be the set of matches that were not pruned, i.e. those
   matches not starting or ending in an expanded state. We say that $\hat h :=
   h^\prunedmatches$ is a \emph{pruning heuristic} version of $h$.
\end{definition}

The hat over the heuristic function ($\hat h$) denotes the implicit dependency
on the progress of the \A, where at each step a different $h^\prunedmatches$ is
used. Our modified \A algorithm~(\cref{sec:astar-code})
works for pruning heuristics by ensuring that the $f$-value of a state is
up-to-date before expanding it, and otherwise \emph{reorders} it in the priority
queue. Even though match pruning violates the admissibility of our heuristics
for some nodes, we prove that \A is sill guaranteed to find a shortest
path~(\cref{sec:pruning-proof}). To this end, we show that our pruning
heuristics are \emph{\wah{}s}~(\cref{dfn:weak-admissible}) in the sense that
they are admissible on at least one path from $v_s$ to $v_t$.

\begin{restatable}{thm}{thmpartialadmissibledfn}\label{thm:weak-admissible-dfn}
  \A with a \wah finds a shortest path.
\end{restatable}

\begin{restatable}{thm}{thmpartialadmissibleh}\label{thm:weak-admissible-h}
  The pruning heuristics $\hshS$\,, $\hcshS$\,, $\hgchS$\, are \wa.
\end{restatable}

Pruning will allow us to scale
near-linearly with sequence length, without sacrificing optimality of the
resulting alignment.
