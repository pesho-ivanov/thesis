\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

% Summary of the paper
\astarpa solves global pairwise alignment provably exact and empirically fast.
To this end, we extended the existing \sh for \A with inexact matches, match
chaining, gap costs, match pruning, and diagonal-transition. We proved that our
novel heuristics and optimizations are guaranteed to find an alignment with
minimal edit distance.

On random sequences with $d{\leq}8\%$ uniform divergence, the runtime of
\astarpa scales near-linearly to very long sequences ($n{\leq}10^7\bp$) and
outperforms other exact aligners. On long ONT reads of human data with $d{\leq}10\%$,
\astarpa is over $2\times$ faster than other aligners, and $1.4\times$ faster
when genetic variation is also present.
