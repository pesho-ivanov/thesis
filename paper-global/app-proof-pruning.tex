\subsection{Match pruning} \label{sec:pruning-proof}

During the \A search, we continuously improve our heuristic using match pruning.
The pruning increases the value of our heuristics and breaks their admissibility.
Nevertheless, we prove in two steps that \A with match pruning still finds a
shortest path. First, we introduce the concept of a \emph{\wah} and show that \A
using a \wah finds a shortest path~(\cref{thm:weak-admissible-dfn}). Then, we
show that our pruning heuristics are indeed \wa~(\cref{thm:weak-admissible-h}).
