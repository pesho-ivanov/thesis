\paragraph{Motivation}
Sequence alignment has been at the core of computational biology for half a
century. Still, it is an open problem to design a practical algorithm for exact
alignment of a pair of related sequences in linear-like
time~\citep{medvedev2022theoretical}.
\paragraph{Methods}
We solve exact global pairwise alignment with respect to edit distance by using
the \A~shortest path algorithm. In order to efficiently align long sequences
with high divergence, we extend the recently proposed
\emph{seed~heuristic}~\citep{ivanov2022fast} with \emph{match~chaining},
\emph{gap~costs}, and \emph{inexact~matches}. We additionally integrate the novel
\emph{match~pruning} technique and
diagonal~transition~\citep{ukkonen1985algorithms} to improve the \A search. We
prove the correctness of our algorithm, implement it in the \astarpa aligner,
and justify our extensions intuitively and empirically.
\paragraph{Results}
On random sequences of divergence $d{=}4\%$ and length $n$, the empirical
runtime of \astarpa scales near-linearly (best~fit~$n^{1.05}$, $n{\leq}10^7\bp$).
A similar scaling remains up to $d{=}12\%$ (best~fit~$n^{1.24}$,
$n{\leq}10^7\bp$). For $n{=}10^7\bp$ and $d{=}4\%$, \astarpa reaches ${>}300\times$
speedup compared to the leading exact aligners \edlib and \wfa. 
%
The performance of \astarpa is highly influenced by long gaps.
On long ($n{>}500\kbp$) ONT reads of a human sample it efficiently aligns
sequences with $d{<}10\%$, leading to $2\times$ median speedup compared to \edlib
and \wfa. When the sequences come from different human samples, \astarpa
performs $1.4\times$ faster than \edlib and \wfa.
