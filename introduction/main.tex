\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

The most basic operations one can do with texts is to modify them letter by
letter, to compare two texts, and to search texts in a big corpus. This thesis
considers comparison and approximate search applied to genetic ``texts'', also
known as \emph{sequence alignment}. Sequence alignment has been a core problem
in computational biology for the last half-century. Nevertheless, it is still
considered an open problem since it is still not known whether exact pairwise
alignment is possible in linear time for related
sequences~\citep{medvedev2022theoretical}. We will approach this question using
the \A informed search algorithm.
