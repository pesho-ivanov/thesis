An algorithm without an objective function may be wrong because they do not
solve the correct problem. or because they 

Algorithms that guarantee correctness can be wrong only by being given a wrong problem.

An approximate algorithm can be wrong either because it did not fullfill its
mathematical goal. reach its solve the problem because of either optimizing the
\emph{wrong} function.

Algorithm correctness is arguably a useful property which is often not simple to
guarantee. It can undoubtedly improve accuracy, especially in the case of
complex data, but still be wrong from biological point of view. This is because
of  This Nevertheless, since biology is a natural science, its  optimality
guarantees must have an additional impact on the development of the field. It
not only but allows to enjoy being wrong rather than vague. Moreove, often
problems in computational biology are ill-stated andalgorithms that approximate
algorithms that. But many algorithms in computational biology do not even have a
formal statement 

\section{Motivation}

Observation 1: A long query has more information that may hint towards the best
mapping place. Unlike the practical approximate algorithms, the existing optimal
algorithm do not exploit this information. As a result, all state-of-the-art
optimal algorithms take longer to map a longer query to a reference. 

Observation 2: The input is linear, the output is linear, the best case is
linear. On the other hand all optimal solutions are near-quadratic and the
theoretical limit is near-quadratic. To spead up beyond this near-quadratic
barrier, current practical algorithms break the optimality guarantee hoping that
the produced alignments are accurate enough. 

%But it is possible to be fast and accurate in the same time?
We take another approach: we preserve the optimality guarantee and use
substantially more information with the hope to be fast enough. As it turns out,
when the error rate is limited, our optimal solutions empirically scale
near-linearly up to very long sequences. This translates to many orders of
magnitude of runtime speedup compared to state-of-the-art optimal aligners.

Sequence alignment is a class of combinatorial problems that is of primary
importance for analysis of genetic data. Algorithms and tools for alignment have
been thoroughly developed and routinely used for genome assembly, RNA
quantification, detecting splicing, oncology, multiple sequence alignment (MSA),
and evolutionary biology. Types of sequence alignment include global alignment,
semi-global alignment, mapping, local alignment, and others. For each type, a
common tradeoff that had to be done is between the alignment accuracy and the
performance to find it.

% graph reference
An additional difficulty is the fact that in the
upcoming pangenomic era, these algorithms must be also applicable to complex
graph structures. For more than 60 years, a linear sequence has been extremely
useful as a representation of a single genome. The affordability of sequencing
technologies enables not only to sequence genomes deeper but also to sequence
many genomes (e.g. of organisms or single cells), building a pangenome (an
abstracted genome that represents the genetic variation of a whole clade). The
shift towards population studies in the last decade motivates the adoption of
graph data structures which serve as compressed representations of collections
of related genomes (genomes are paths in the graph).

% A* context 
An optimal alignment can naturally be represented as a shortest path in an
alignment graph (equivalent to the DP table). In order to find such a shortest
path with minimal exploration, we instantiate the A* algorithm with a novel
heuristic function based on the unaligned parts of the sequences. This
additional information is a problem-specific heuristic function and it heavily
determines the efficiency of the search. For any explored state by A*, this
heuristic function should compute a lower bound on the remaining path length, or
more specifically, the minimal cost of edit operations needed to align the
remaining sequences.

\paragraph{Main contributions}
We have effectively applied the \A algorithm to optimal sequence alignment. We
demontrated that the additional information from the whole sequence can improve
the scaling with query length, reference size and error rate, substantially
decrease the necessary computations, and result in algorithms that are orders of
magnitude faster than existing optimal algorithms. We apply the \A approach to
two types of alignment: semi-global (mapping) and global.
