\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

The most basic operations one can do with texts is to modify them letter by
letter, to compare two texts, and to search texts in a big corpus. This thesis
considers comparison and approximate search applied to genetic ``texts'', also
known as \emph{sequence alignment}. Sequence alignment has been a core problem
in computational biology for the last half-century. We know that in the general
case, it is not solvable for strictly subquadratic time but the approximate
algorithms that are used in practice seem to be scale much better. We employ  
the \A informed search algorithm in an attempt to design an optimal algorithm
that scales subquadratically for related sequences.
