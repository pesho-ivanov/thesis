This thesis considers two basic related tasks on ``texts'': comparison and
search. In the context of molecular biology, they are generally known as
\emph{sequence alignment}.

Sequence alignment has been a core problem in
computational biology for the last half-century with a multitude of
applications. In its general case, it is not solvable for strictly subquadratic
time which is often prohibitively slow. Faster approximate algorithms are
instead used in practice. We employ  
the \A informed search algorithm in order to design an optimal algorithm that
scales subquadratically for related sequences.
