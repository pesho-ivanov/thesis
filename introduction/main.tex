\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

Two basic operations one can do with two texts is to compare them, and to search
for one in the other. This thesis considers comparison and approximate search
applied to genetic ``texts'', also known as \emph{sequence alignment}. Sequence
alignment has been a core problem in computational biology for the last
half-century with a multitude of applications. In its general case, it is not
solvable for strictly subquadratic time which is often prohibitively slow.
Faster approximate algorithms are instead used in practice. We employ  
the \A informed search algorithm in order to design an optimal algorithm that
scales subquadratically for related sequences.
