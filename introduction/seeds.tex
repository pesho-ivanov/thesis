Seed-and-extend is a commonly used paradigm for solving semi-global alignment
approximately~\citep{kucherov2019evolution}. Seeds are also used to define and
compute LCSk~\citep{benson2014longest}, a generalization of longest common
subsequence (LCS). In contrast, our \emph{\sh} speeds up finding an optimal
alignment by using seed matches to speed up the \A search. A limitation of the
existing \sh is the low tolerance to increasing error rates due to using only
long exact matches without accounting for their order.

Our seed heuristic uses seeds in a very different way than existing seeding
approaches: instead of searching for a good alignment around seed matches, it
punishes potential alignments by the lack of matches. This negation makes the
difference between finding a good alignment and proving that no other alignment
is better.
