\paragraph{Seeds, and matches}

Seed-and-extend is a commonly used paradigm for solving semi-global alignment
approximately~\citep{kucherov2019evolution}. Seeds are also used to define and
compute LCSk~\citep{benson2014longest}, a generalization of longest common
subsequence (LCS). In contrast, our \emph{\sh} speeds up finding an optimal
alignment by using seed matches to speed up the \A search. A limitation of the
existing \sh is the low tolerance to increasing error rates due to using only
long exact matches without accounting for their order.
