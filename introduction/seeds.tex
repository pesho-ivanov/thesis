\paragraph{Seeds, and matches}

Seed-and-extend is a commonly used paradigm for solving semi-global
alignment approximately~\citep{kucherov2019evolution}.
Seeds are also used to define and compute LCSk~\citep{benson2014longest}, a
generalization of longest common subsequence (LCS). In contrast, the \emph{\sh}
by~\citet{ivanov2022fast} speeds up finding an optimal alignment by
using seed matches to speed up the \A search. The \sh enables
empirical near-linear scaling to long HiFi reads (up to $30\kbp$ with $0.3\%$
errors)~\citep{ivanov2022fast}. A limitation of the existing \sh is the low
tolerance to increasing error rates due to using only long exact matches without
accounting for their order.
