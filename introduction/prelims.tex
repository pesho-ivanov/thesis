\subsection{Alignment as shortest path}

Alignment is equivalent to shortest path.

\paragraph{\dijkstra and \A}
\dijkstra's algorithm \citep{dijkstra1959note} finds a shortest path from $v_s$
to~$v_t$ by \emph{expanding} vertices in order of increasing distance $\g(u)$
from the start. The \A algorithm~\citep{hart1968formal,pearl1984heuristics},
instead, directs the search towards a target by expanding vertices in order of
increasing ${f(u) := g(u) + h(u)}$, where $h(u)$ is a heuristic function that
estimates the distance $\h(u)$ to the end and $g(u)$ is the shortest length of a
path from $v_s$ to $u$ found so far. A heuristic is \emph{admissible} if it is a
lower bound on the remaining distance, $h(u) \leq \h(u)$, which guarantees that
\A has found a shortest path as soon as it expands $v_t$. Heuristic $h_1$
\emph{dominates} another heuristic $h_2$ when $h_1(u) \ge h_2(u)$ for all vertices $u$.
A dominant heuristic will usually, but not always~\citep{holte2010common},
expand less vertices. Note that \dijkstra's algorithm is
equivalent to \A using a heuristic that is always $0$, and that both algorithms
require non-negative edge costs. Our variant of the \A algorithm is provided
in~\cref{GLOBALsec:astar}.
