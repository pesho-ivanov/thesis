% Optimality, heuristic speed
In this thesis we introduce a novel principled approach for provably optimal and
heuristically fast sequence alignment. The underlying idea of this thesis is to
speed up the search of an optimal alignment using information from the whole
sequences, and not only from the aligned parts as existing algorithms do. We
apply our approach to sequence-to-graph semi-global alignment (for read mapping)
and global alignment. The question that we target is how general can the input
sequences be while we could still efficiently compute provably-optimal
alignments. To this end, we introduce novel algorithmic and data structure
techniques, prove their correctness, and implement them as free and open source
tools. Our evaluations demonstrate that remarkable performance scaling up to
huge references, very long queries/sequences and high error rates. In absolute
terms, we demontrate orders of magnitude of speedup compared to existing optimal
algorithm on synthetic and real data.
