We have effectively applied the \A algorithm to optimal sequence alignment. We
demontrated that the additional information from the whole sequence can improve
the scaling with query length, reference size and error rate, substantially
decrease the necessary computations, and result in algorithms that are orders of
magnitude faster than existing optimal algorithms. We apply the \A approach to
two types of alignment: semi-global (alignment) and global.

\subsection{Optimality}

\subsection{Scaling} %with reference size, query length and error rate}
Informed search: Two-stage algorithm, similar to Aho-Corasick, increasingly more information (length, prefix, seeds, chaining seeds, chaining seeds + gaps)

\subsection{Applicability} %Aligning to a general graph}
