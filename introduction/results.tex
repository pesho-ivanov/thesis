We have effectively applied the \A algorithm to optimal sequence alignment. We
demontrated that the additional information from the whole sequence can improve
the scaling with query length, reference size and error rate, substantially
decrease the necessary computations, and result in algorithms that are orders of
magnitude faster than existing optimal algorithms. We apply the \A approach to
two types of alignment: semi-global (alignment) and global.

\subsection*{Principled approach by shortest paths}
shortest paths,

A*, admissibility

\subsection*{Optimality guarantees}
To ensure that our algorithms are practical, we introduce a number of
algorithmic optimizations which increase performance and decrease memory
footprint.

We also prove that all optimizations (greedy matching, ) are preserving the optimality.

\subsection*{Scaling with reference size using a trie index}

\input{\dir/seed-and-extend}
\input{\dir/scaling}

\subsection*{Scaling with query length using a seed heuristic}

\subsection*{Scaling with error rate using inexact matching and chaining}

Informed search: Two-stage algorithm, similar to Aho-Corasick, increasingly more information (length, prefix, seeds, chaining seeds, chaining seeds + gaps)

\subsection*{Aligning to general graph references}

\subsection*{Implementations}
