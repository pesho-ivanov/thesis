\paragraph{Dynamic programming} The standard approach to sequence alignment is
by successively aligning prefixes of the first sequence to prefixes of the
second. \citet{vintsyuk1968speech} was the first to introduce this $\Oh(nm)$
dynamic programming (DP) approach for a comparing a pair speech signals with $n$
and $m$ elements. Independently, it was applied to compute edit distance for
biological
sequences~\citep{needleman1970general,sankoff1972matching,sellers1974theory,wagner1974string}.
This well-known algorithm is implemented in modern aligners  like
\seqan~\citep{reinert2017seqan} and \parasail~\citep{daily2016parasail}.
Improving the performance of these quadratic algorithms has been a central goal
in later works.
