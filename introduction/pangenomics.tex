\section{Pangenomes and reference graphs}

The shortest path approach naturally fits more complex references than linear.
In fact, any graph reference (incl. cycles) is fine.

First attempts to include variation into the reference data structure were made
by augmenting the local alignment method to consider alternative walks during the
extend step~\cite{schneeberger_simultaneous_2009,palmapper}. This approach has
since been extended from the linear reference case to graph references. To
represent non-reference variation of multiple references during the seeding
stage, HISAT2 uses generalized compressed suffix
arrays~\cite{siren_indexing_2014} to index walks in an augmented reference
sequence, forming a local genome graph~\cite{kim_graphbased_2019}.
VG~\cite{garrison_variation_2018} uses a similar
technique~\cite{siren_indexing_2017} to index variation graphs representing a
population of references.

% paper-trie; The benefit from genome graphs
Historically, a single linear reference sequence has been used to represent the
most common variants in a population. While providing a working abstraction for
most cases, rare or sub-population specific variation is especially hard to
model in this setting, creating a reference allele
bias~\cite{stevenson_sources_2013,brandt_mapping_2015}. Consequently, in the
last few years, the field has shifted first towards using sets of reference
sequences, and more recently to graph data structures (so-called {\em genome
graphs}), to represent many genomes or haplotypes
simultaneously~\cite{dilthey_improved_2015,paten_genome_2017,garrison_variation_2018}.
