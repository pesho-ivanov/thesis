\section{Alignment problem}

% Sequencing and variant calling
The analysis and understanding of genetic variation encoded in the genome of an
organism lies at the center of computational biology and medicine. Variation is
usually identified through matching sequences obtained from DNA/RNA-sequencing
back to a reference (genome) sequence in the process of \emph{variant calling},
making the alignment task a core problem in sequence bioinformatics.
