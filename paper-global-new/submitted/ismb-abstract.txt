We present a fast exact algorithm for global pairwise alignment between related
sequences with unit edit costs. It instantiates the A* shortest path algorithm
with a novel chained-seeds heuristic that improves as the search progresses.

Chained-seeds heuristic. We partition the first sequence into short seeds, and
find their matches in the second sequence. The heuristic is defined as the
lowest cost of a chain of remaining matches. It combines the seed costs of
skipped remaining seeds, and the gap costs between consecutive matches in a
chain. To efficiently compute the heuristic, we introduce a contours data
structure.

Match pruning. To further reduce the number of states that the A* explores, we
ignore (prune) already expanded matches in the heuristic computation. We prove
that pruning preserves a shortest path.

Results. Our aligner, A*PA, demonstrates near-linear runtime (best fit: n^1.09)
on random related genetic sequences with e = 5% uniform error rate and length n
≤ 10^7 bp. Compared to the leading exact aligners Edlib and BiWFA, A*PA reaches
> 400x speedup for n = 10^7 bp and e = 5%, and 2.5x speedup for simulated ONT
reads from a human genome (n ≈ 10^6 bp, e ≈ 10% errors).
