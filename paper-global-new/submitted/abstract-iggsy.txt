Exact pairwise alignment using ordered seed heuristic for A*
P. Ivanov, R. Groot Koerkamp

We present a novel algorithm to compute the global pairwise sequence alignment of
long sequences with uniform mutations,
based on a novel \emph{ordered seed heuristic} for running A* on the edit graph.

The heuristic partitions the first sequence into short seeds and finds all
matches in the second sequence.
From this we infer a lower bound on the cost of aligning suffixes of the two
sequences based on the cost of aligning each of the remaining seeds in order.

We reduce the number of states explored during the A* using the general
observation called \emph{multiple-path pruning} that once a shortest path to a
node is found, no other paths to that node can improve the global solution. This
allows us to use a \emph{dynamic heuristic} that improves as the A* progresses.

We test our method on pairs of random sequences with uniform error rate $e$.
For $e=0.1$, we demonstrate that our method scales with $O(n^{1.3})$ for lengths from
$10^4$ to $10^7$, and outperforms single-threaded algorithms Edlib and WFA for
sequences longer than $10^4$. For $e=0.01$ our method scales with
$O(n^{1.2})$ and outperforms WFA for sequences longer than $2\cdot 10^5$.
Furthermore, evaluations show that the number of states explored by the A* is within a
constant factor of the theoretical lower bound in this regime.
