I would like to thank \dots

To my parents Ivo and Svetla for their dedication to the development of my
life-long curiousity.

Martin -- for introducing me to the formal methods providing guarantees.

Gagandeep -- for using heuristics (machine learning) only for optimizing a
solution within a framework that provides correctness guarantees.

Pencho -- for telling me that new and expensive data is not necessary to make
good scientific contributions.

Mitko -- for insisting on the formalization even of the very vague biological
problems.

Ragnar -- for following my invitation to the topic and .

Arshavir -- for the support on the path towards the defense.
