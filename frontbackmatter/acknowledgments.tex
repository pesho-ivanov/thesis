% family
First of all, I am lucky and grateful to have such parents as Ivo and Svetla who
fully dedicated themselves to my development, introduced me to their professions
of engineering and medicine, and supported my enourmous freedom in life.

% teachers and mentors
Martin -- for introducing me to the formal methods providing guarantees.

% colleagues
Mitko -- for insisting on the formalization even of the very vague biological
problems.

Arshavir -- for the support on the path towards the defense.

Pavol for his academical advices

Pencho, Kremi -- for telling me that new and expensive data is not necessary to make
good scientific contributions.

Gagandeep -- for sparking the idea that heuristics and machine learning are a
viable instrument for performance optimization within a framework that provides
correctness guarantees.

Biomedical students for their openness for collaboration regardless of the
different worlds.

ShAD bioinformatics school of Mikhail Gelfand, teachers, co-students.

Sergey Nurk, Pavel Pevzner's lab in St.Petersburg for introducing me to
algorithmic biology.

Direct collaborators Beni and Martin for pedantically insisting on correctness
and clarity, so much needed in the field of biological sciences.

Direct collaborators Harun, Andre and Gunnar for directing towards state of the art results.

Iskren Chernev, Ragnar Groot Koerkamp and Mykola Akulov -- who believed me about
the research direction and invested their time and effort to advance projects
that stem from my publications.

The students and friends who patiently listened and discussed my research,
allowing it to get clearer and more intelligible.

I thank the anonymous reviewers for the valuable feedback, the sanity check and
the acceptance to the community. 

% friends, partners, phd students

Fabio
Yavor Milanov -- for exposing me to his artistic disrespect to life and for the beautiful cover

Girl friends Lena, Julia.
Valeria Orsi 
Margo -- for her support in accepting the academic reality without sacrificing myself.

the countless scientists and philosophers who developed the human knowledge to
the current level, and in particular, to those researchers who established the
building blocks of my research half a century ago

% rest

The countless friends, who hosted me, supported me, and added to the creative
environment. All my virtual and imaginary friends in books, sensual evenings,
for the human connection. Vipassana meditation, Shawn -- for the opportunity for
calm concentration which resulted in the invention of the seed heuristic. The
first author is grateful for the Vipassana meditation which inspired the idea to
punish paths for the absence of foreseeable seed matches.

I would like to thank the hundreds of unnamed friends, family members, fellow
travellers and couchsurfers, hippies, academics, wikipedia contributors, people
who supported my development and curiosity throughout my life, and allowed me to
touch my childhood dream of science which resulted in this thesis.
