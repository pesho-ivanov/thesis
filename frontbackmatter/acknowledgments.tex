I would like to thank \dots

To my parents Ivo and Svetla for their dedication to the development of my
life-long curiousity.

Martin -- for introducing me to the formal methods providing guarantees.

Gagandeep -- for sparking the idea that heuristics and machine learning are a
viable instrument for performance optimization within a framework that provides
correctness guarantees.

Pencho -- for telling me that new and expensive data is not necessary to make
good scientific contributions.

Mitko -- for insisting on the formalization even of the very vague biological
problems.

Ragnar -- for following my invitation to the topic and .

Arshavir -- for the support on the path towards the defense.

those academicians who I contemn -- for grounding my scientific idealism 

Iskren, Iva, Yavor, Megi -- for the place for writing

Margo -- for her support in accepting the academic reality without sacrificing myself.

Vipassana meditation -- for the opportunity for calm concentration which
resulted in the invention of the seed heuristic.
