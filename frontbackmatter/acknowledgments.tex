% family
I am lucky to have such supportive parents as Ivo and Svetla who fully dedicated
themselves to my development, introduced me to their professions of engineering
and medicine, and supported my immense freedom in life, and sow my childhood
dream for science.

% teachers, mentors, summer camps, schools
I am greatful for the opportunities to study, teach and socialize with teachers,
mentors fellow students in numerous schools and Summer camps, most notably the
A\&B informatics school in Shumen~(Bulgaria) by Biserka Yovcheva, Summer
computer school in Russia by Victor Matyukhin, physics preparations for IYPT in
Shumen by Svilen Rusev, Yandex ShAD bioinformatics evening school in Moscow by
Mikhail Gelfand~(mentored by Konstantin Severinov), Algorithmic Biology Lab in
St.Petersburg by Pavel Pevzner~(mentored by Sergey Nurk).

% SRL
I owe my first academic steps the~(then called) Software Reliability Lab in
ETH~Zurich by Martin Vechev who supported my academic freedom for combining
biology and informatics and guided the principled approach to formal
correctness. I am especially thankful to my colleagues Benjamin Bichsel~(Beni)
and Dimitar K. Dimitrov~(Mitko) for their pedantic attitude towards correctness
and consistency, so much needed in the biological sciences. I also thank Pavol
Bielik who smoothed my acceptance of academia and also motivated the
mathematical rigorousness even for biomedical problems. I borrowed Gagandeep
Singh's idea that machine learning can be used to speed up solutions with
guaranteed correctness, given a suitable framework such as the seed heuristics
presented in this thesis.

% Other labs
I am grateful to my coauthors Harun Mustafa, André Kahles and Gunnar Rätsch for
directing my work towards practical results. and the Dermatology Clinic in
University of Zurich~(by Emmanuella Guenova). Biomedical students for their
openness for collaboration regardless of the different worlds. I thank Arshavir
Ter-Gabrielyan for his assistance in the path towards my defense.

% A* for alignment
I am pleased to see that the amazing coders Ragnar Groot Koerkamp and Iskren
Chernev trusted my invitations and developed tools for optimal sequence
alignment based on \A. Working with them is a pleasure for me and I am curious
where we will bring this research direction.

% friends, phd students
I thank my friend Fabio Pak who was with me during all ups and downs during my
PhD, Yavor Milanov who introduced me to his disrespect of art and made the
beautiful thesis cover, Pencho Yordanov who convinced me that new and expensive
data is not the only path towards good science.

I am greatful to Vipassana meditation for the calm concentration which and my
meditation friend Shawn Prest -- for the opportunity for calm concentration
which resulted in the invention of the seed heuristic. The first author is
grateful for the Vipassana meditation which inspired the idea to punish paths
for the absence of foreseeable seed matches.
I thank the anonymous paper reviewers for their valuable feedback, confirming
the sanity of my ideas, and for being accepting to new academicians like me. 

% Orsi, Bagrevi,
Margo -- for her support in accepting the academic reality without sacrificing myself.

% rest
The countless friends, teachers, students, academics, past scientists and
philosophers, who patiently listened and discussed, shared and taught me their
perspectives, allowing me to better understand and present my research.
Additionally, I acknoledge the impact on me of my virtual friends, fellow
travellers and couchsurfers, hippies, vegans, meditators, paragliding pilots,
wikipedia contributors, psychonauts, and lovers, who shared their passions with
me, hosted me, supported me, and contributed creativity to my environment.
