I would like to thank \dots

To my parents Ivo and Svetla for their dedication to the development of my
life-long curiousity.

Martin -- for introducing me to the formal methods providing guarantees.

Gagandeep -- for sparking the idea that heuristics and machine learning are a
viable instrument for performance optimization within a framework that provides
correctness guarantees.

Pencho, Kremi -- for telling me that new and expensive data is not necessary to make
good scientific contributions.

Mitko -- for insisting on the formalization even of the very vague biological
problems.

Ragnar -- for following my invitation to the topic and .

Arshavir -- for the support on the path towards the defense.

those academicians who I contemn -- for grounding my scientific idealism 

Yavor, Megi, Iskren, Iva, -- for the place for writing

Margo -- for her support in accepting the academic reality without sacrificing myself.

All my virtual and imaginary friends for the human connection.

Direct collaborators Beni and Martin for pedantically insisting on correctness
and clarity, so much needed in the field of biological sciences.

Girl friends Lena, Julia.

Direct collaborators Harun, Andre and Gunnar for directing towards state of the art results.

Vipassana meditation, Shawn -- for the opportunity for calm concentration which
resulted in the invention of the seed heuristic.
