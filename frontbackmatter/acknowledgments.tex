I would like to thank \dots

To my parents Ivo and Svetla for their dedication to the development of my
life-long curiousity.

Martin -- for introducing me to the formal methods providing guarantees.

Gagandeep -- for sparking the idea that heuristics and machine learning are a
viable instrument for performance optimization within a framework that provides
correctness guarantees.

Pencho, Kremi -- for telling me that new and expensive data is not necessary to make
good scientific contributions.

Mitko -- for insisting on the formalization even of the very vague biological
problems.

Biomedical students for their openness for collaboration regardless of the
different worlds.

I thank the anonymous reviewers for the valuable feedback, the sanity check and
the acceptance to the community. 
Ragnar -- for following my invitation to the topic and .
%The authors are grateful to Mykola~Akulov for his help with
%producing~\cref{GLOBALfig:comparison,GLOBALfig:contours}.

Arshavir -- for the support on the path towards the defense.

Yavor, Megi, Iskren, Iva, -- for the place for writing

Margo -- for her support in accepting the academic reality without sacrificing myself.

ShAD bioinformatics school of Mikhail Gelfand, teachers, co-students.

Sergey Nurk, Pavel Pevzner's lab in St.Petersburg for introducing me to
algorithmic biology.

Direct collaborators Beni and Martin for pedantically insisting on correctness
and clarity, so much needed in the field of biological sciences.

Girl friends Lena, Julia.

Valeria Orsi 

Direct collaborators Harun, Andre and Gunnar for directing towards state of the art results.

All other friends, who hosted me, supported
me, and added to the creative environment.
All my virtual and imaginary friends in books, wikipedia, couchsurfing, sensual
evenings, for the human connection. 
Vipassana meditation, Shawn -- for the opportunity for calm concentration which
resulted in the invention of the seed heuristic. The first author is grateful
for the Vipassana meditation which inspired the idea to punish paths for the
absence of foreseeable seed matches.
