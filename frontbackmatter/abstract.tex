% Problem
%Biological sequences do not generally
%align perfectly due to biological differences and technical errors. Given two
%sequences, the desired alignment is a position-to-position correspondence
%between two sequences which minimizes the edit costs (substitutions, insertions
%or deletions).
%This task is closely related to calculating \emph{edit distance}.

% Existing algorithms
% by using heuristic
%information to speed up the alignment without sacrificing correctness.
%to to making it both heuristically fast and provably optimal. 

%Can we use the \A algorithm to find provably optimal alignment heuristically
%fast?

%Practical alignment algorithms are desired to \textcircled{1} find accurate
%alignments, \textcircled{2} apply to a wide range of data, and \textcircled{3}
%use little time and memory.

% Shortest path formulation
%We consider a principled alignment formulation based on shortest paths and
%demonstrate that the \A shortest path algorithm can be used to outperform
%current methods. Unlike existing methods, \A enables an \emph{informed search}
%based on information from the unaligned sequence suffixes, thus radically

%Runtime, memory usage, scaling. Data variation A good algorithm should be
%optimal, complete, performant (fast and low on memory)

%polynomial speed ups on real data. It \textcircled{1} provides optimality
%guarantees according to edit distance, \textcircled{2} scales to long and noisy
%sequences, and \textcircled{3} scales subquadratically with sequence length.

%To scale to large reference sequences, we extend the graph with a trie index. To
%scale to long queries, we introduce design an admissible \emph{seed heuristic},
%which is provably-optimal also efficient to compute. To scale to high error
%rates, we design  

%improving the empirical runtime scaling (up to linear) in the average case while
%providing optimality guarantees.
