\subsection{Expanded states and equivalent band} \label{GLOBALsec:expanded}

\input{\dir/fig-band}

\cref{GLOBALtab:band} shows the \emph{equivalent band} of each alignment: the number
of expanded states divided by $n$. An equivalent band of $1$ is the theoretical
optimum for equal sequences, resulting from expanding only the states on the
main diagonal. The equivalent band for \CSH is always lower than the equivalent
band for \SH because the \csh dominates over \sh. In practice, this difference
becomes significant for large enough $e$ and $n$ ($e{>}5\%$ and $n{>}10^5$). The
equivalent band of \SH and \CSH is constant for $e{=}1\%$, indicating a linear
scaling with $n$. In other cases ($e{\leq}5\%$ for \SH and $e{\leq}15\%$ for
\CSH), the band increases slowly with $n$, indicating a near-linear scaling.
