\section{Evaluations} \label{GLOBALsec:evals}

We implemented the algorithms from~\cref{GLOBALsec:methods} in the aligner \astarpa
and refer to the two of our algorithms as \SH for \sh, and \CSH for \csh. Here
we empirically compare the runtime and memory usage to the exact optimal
aligners \edlib and \wfa on both synthetic and real data. We demonstrate the
benefit of match pruning on the runtime scaling with sequence length, and the
benefits from match chaining and inexact matches on scaling to high error rates.
All code, evaluation scripts and data are available in the \astarpa repository.
