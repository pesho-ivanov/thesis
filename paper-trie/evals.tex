In this section we present a thorough experimental
evaluation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/eth-sri/astarix/tree/RECOMB2020_experiments}}
of \astarix on simulated Illumina reads. Our evaluation demonstrates that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \astarix is faster than \dijkstra because the heuristic reduces the number of explored states by an order of magnitude.
  \item The runtime of \astarix scales better than state-of-the-art optimal
  aligners with increasing graph size, on a variety of reference graphs.
\end{enumerate}
