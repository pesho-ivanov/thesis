	We present an algorithm for the \emph{optimal alignment} of sequences to
	\emph{genome graphs}. It works by phrasing the edit distance minimization
	task as finding a shortest path on an implicit alignment graph. To find a
	shortest path, we instantiate the \A paradigm with a novel domain-specific
	heuristic function that accounts for the upcoming subsequence in the query
	to be aligned, resulting in a provably optimal alignment algorithm called
	\astarix.
	
	\quad \quad Experimental evaluation of \astarix shows that it is 1--2
	orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art optimal algorithms on the
	task of aligning Illumina reads to reference genome graphs. Implementations
	and evaluations are available at \mbox{\astarixurl}.
