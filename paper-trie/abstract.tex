Motivation: all optimal algorithms have to iterate over the whole reference for
each query. We should be able to optimize this by precomputation.

We present an algorithm for the \emph{optimal alignment} of sequences to
\emph{genome graphs}. It works by phrasing the edit distance minimization
task as finding a shortest path on an implicit alignment graph. To find a
shortest path, we instantiate the \A paradigm with a novel domain-specific
heuristic function that accounts for the upcoming subsequence in the query
to be aligned, resulting in a provably optimal alignment algorithm called
\astarix.

\quad \quad Experimental evaluation of \astarix shows that it is 1--2
orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art optimal algorithms on the
task of aligning Illumina reads to reference genome graphs. Implementations
and evaluations are available at \mbox{\astarixurl}.
