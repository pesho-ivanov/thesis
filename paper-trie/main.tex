\chapter{Scaling with reference size} \label{ch:trie}
\graphicspath{{\dir/}}

In this chapter we apply \A to semi-global alignment of a set of reads to a
general graph reference. We supplement the reference graph with a trie index,
enabling sublinear scaling of the alignment time with the reference size. Even
for moderate size references, this results in orders of magnitude of speedup
compared to other optimal algorithms.
