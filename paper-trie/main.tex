\chapter{Scaling with reference size} \label{ch:trie}
\graphicspath{{\dir/}}

In this chapter we consider the problem of semi-global alignment of a set of
reads to a general graph reference. We supplement the reference graph with a
trie index and run shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra and \A with a very simple
heuristic) that start aligning from the trie root. We demonstrate that using a
trie index enables sublinear scaling of the alignment time with the reference
size. Even for moderate size references, we rearch orders of magnitude of
speedup compared to other optimal algorithms.
