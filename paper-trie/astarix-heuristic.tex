\subsection{\astarix: Instantiating \A} \label{TRIEsubsec:astarix-heuristic}
\cref{TRIEalg:astarix} shows an unoptimized version of \astarix and its heuristic
function.
%
\astarix expects a reference graph (\cref{TRIElin:reference}) and a query
(\cref{TRIElin:astarix}) as input, and returns an optimal alignment (\cref{TRIElin:ret})
by searching for a shortest path from $S$ to $T$ in the alignment graph $\AG$.
It is parameterized by hyper-parameters ($d$ in \cref{TRIElin:d}, more in
\cref{TRIEsec:optimizations}) and edit costs (implicitly provided).

The function \textsc{Heuristic}
(\crefrange{TRIElin:heuristic-start}{TRIElin:heuristic-end}) computes a lower bound on
the remaining cost of a best alignment: the minimum cost $h(u,s)$ of aligning
the \emph{upcoming sequence} $s$ (where $\lvert s \rvert \leq d$) starting from
node $u$. Importantly, $s$ is limited to the next $d' \leq d$ letters of $q$,
starting from query position $i$. Thus, computing $h(u,s)$ is substantially
cheaper than aligning all remaining letters of $q$.

To compute $h(u,s)$ we leverage a simple branch-and-bound algorithm, provided in
\cref{TRIEapp:recursive-align}. In the following, for convenience, we refer to the
heuristic as $h$ (which is parameterized by $(u,s)$) instead of
\textsc{Heuristic} (which is parameterized by $\langle u, i \rangle$). Further,
we say that $h$ is optimistic if $h(u,s)$ is a lower bound on the cost for
aligning all remaining letters (\ie, $q[i:|q|]$) starting from node $u$ (note
that $s$ is a prefix of $q[i:|q|]$).

\begin{samepage}
\begin{thm} \label{TRIEthm:optimistic}
	$h$ is optimistic.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
$h$ only considers the next $d'$ letters of $q$ instead of all
remaining letters. Since all costs are non-negative, the theorem follows.
\end{proof}

	$\AG[``\texttt{ATAA}"]$ (right) is based on reference graph $\RG$ (left),

\para{Benefit of \A Heuristic over \dijkstra} \label{TRIEpara:heuristic-benefits}
\cref{TRIEfig:heuristic-benefit} shows the benefit of using our heuristic function
compared to \dijkstra. Here, \dijkstra expands states based on their distance
$g$ from the origin nodes $\st{u}{0}$ and $\st{v}{0}$. Hence, depending on
tie-breaking, \dijkstra may expand all states with $h \leq 1$, as shown in
\cref{TRIEfig:heuristic-benefit}. By contrast, \A chooses the next state to expand
by the sum of the distance from the origin $g$ and the heuristic $h$, expanding
only states with $g+h \leq 1$.

\para{Memoization} \label{TRIEpara:memoization}
Recall that the return value of $h$ in \cref{TRIElin:heuristic-start} only depends
on $u$ and the upcoming sequence $s$ (which in turn depends on $i$ and $d$).
Thus, $h(u,s)$ can be reused for different positions across different queries in
$\Oh(1)$ time, if it was computed for a previous query.
