\subsection{Prefix heuristic for \A} \label{TRIEsubsec:astarix-heuristic}

\cref{TRIEalg:astarix} shows an unoptimized version of \astarix and its heuristic
function.
%
\astarix expects a reference graph (\cref{TRIElin:reference}) and a query
(\cref{TRIElin:astarix}) as input, and returns an optimal alignment (\cref{TRIElin:ret})
by searching for a shortest path from $S$ to $T$ in the alignment graph $\AG$.
It is parameterized by hyper-parameters ($d$ in \cref{TRIElin:d}, more in
\cref{TRIEsec:optimizations}) and edit costs (implicitly provided).

The function \textsc{Heuristic}
(\crefrange{TRIElin:heuristic-start}{TRIElin:heuristic-end}) computes a lower bound on
the remaining cost of a best alignment: the minimum cost $h(u,s)$ of aligning
the \emph{upcoming sequence} $s$ (where $\lvert s \rvert \leq d$) starting from
node $u$. Importantly, $s$ is limited to the next $d' \leq d$ letters of $q$,
starting from query position $i$. Thus, computing $h(u,s)$ is substantially
cheaper than aligning all remaining letters of $q$.

To compute $h(u,s)$ we leverage a simple branch-and-bound algorithm
\textsc{RecursiveAlign}. It recursively looks for the cheapest alignment of $s$
starting from $u$, and does not follow paths whose cost exceeds $\mli{best}$,
the best path found so far.

			\EndIf
			\If{$s = \epsilon$}  % \textbf{or} $u = \mli{border}$}
				\Comment Reached a target
				\State \Return $\mli{curr}$
			\EndIf
			\ForAll{$(u,\mli{v},\ell,w) \in
				\EGE \textbf{ where } \ell \in \{s[0], \epsilon \}$}
				\State $\mli{suff} = s[1:]$ \textbf{if} $\ell \neq \epsilon$ \textbf{else} $s$
				\State $\mli{best} = \Call{RecursiveAlign}{u, \mli{suff}, curr + w, \mli{best}}$
			\EndFor
			\State \Return $\mli{best}$
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In the following, for convenience, we refer to the heuristic as $h$ (which is
parameterized by $(u,s)$) instead of \textsc{Heuristic} (which is parameterized
by $\langle u, i \rangle$). Further, we say that $h$ is admissible if $h(u,s)$
is a lower bound on the cost for aligning all remaining letters (\ie,
$q[i:|q|]$) starting from node $u$ (note that $s$ is a prefix of $q[i:|q|]$).

\begin{samepage}
\begin{thm} \label{TRIEthm:admissible}
	$h$ is admissible.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
$h$ only considers the next $d'$ letters of $q$ instead of all
remaining letters. Since all costs are non-negative, the theorem follows.
\end{proof}

	indicate the distance from the sources $S=\{\langle u,0 \rangle, \langle v,0

\para{Benefit of \A heuristic over \dijkstra} \label{TRIEpara:heuristic-benefits}
\cref{TRIEfig:heuristic-benefit} shows the benefit of using our heuristic function
compared to \dijkstra. Here, \dijkstra expands states based on their distance
$g$ from the origin nodes $\st{u}{0}$ and $\st{v}{0}$. Hence, depending on
tie-breaking, \dijkstra may expand all states with $h \leq 1$, as shown in
\cref{TRIEfig:heuristic-benefit}. By contrast, \A chooses the next state to expand
by the sum of the distance from the origin $g$ and the heuristic $h$, expanding
only states with $g+h \leq 1$.

\para{Memoization} \label{TRIEpara:memoization}
Recall that the return value of $h$ in \cref{TRIElin:heuristic-start} only depends
on $u$ and the upcoming sequence $s$ (which in turn depends on $i$ and $d$).
Thus, $h(u,s)$ can be reused for different positions across different queries in
$\Oh(1)$ time, if it was computed for a previous query.
