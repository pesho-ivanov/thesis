	abstract = {Genomic variations in a reference collection are naturally represented as genome variation graphs. Such graphs encode common subsequences as vertices and the variations are captured using additional vertices and directed edges. The resulting graphs are directed graphs possibly with cycles. Existing algorithms for aligning sequences on such graphs make use of partial order alignment (POA) techniques that work on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). To achieve this, acyclic extensions of the input graphs are first constructed through expensive loop unrolling steps (DAGification). Furthermore, such graph extensions could have considerable blowup in their size and in the worst case the blow-up factor is proportional to the input sequence length. We provide a novel alignment algorithm V-ALIGN that aligns the input sequence directly on the input graph while avoiding such expensive DAGification steps. V-ALIGN is based on a novel dynamic programming (DP) formulation that allows gapped alignment directly on the input graph. It supports affine and linear gaps. We also propose refinements to V-ALIGN for better performance in practice. With the proposed refinements, the time to fill the DP table has linear dependence on the sizes of the sequence, the graph, and its feedback vertex set. We conducted experiments to compare the proposed algorithm against the existing POA-based techniques. We also performed alignment experiments on the genome variation graphs constructed from the 1000 Genomes data. For aligning short sequences, standard approaches restrict the expensive gapped alignment to small filtered subgraphs having high similarity to the input sequence. In such cases, the performance of V-ALIGN for gapped alignment on the filtered subgraph depends on the subgraph sizes.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: As high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology becomes ubiquitous and the volume of data continues to rise, HTS read alignment is becoming increasingly rate-limiting, which keeps pressing the development of novel read alignment approaches. Moreover, promising novel applications of HTS technology require aligning reads to multiple genomes instead of a single reference; however, it is still not viable for the state-of-the-art aligners to align large numbers of reads to multiple genomes.
RESULTS: We propose de Bruijn Graph-based Aligner (deBGA), an innovative graph-based seed-and-extension algorithm to align HTS reads to a reference genome that is organized and indexed using a de Bruijn graph. With its well-handling of repeats, deBGA is substantially faster than state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining similar or higher sensitivity and accuracy. This makes it particularly well-suited to handle the rapidly growing volumes of sequencing data. Furthermore, it provides a promising solution for aligning reads to multiple genomes and graph-based references in HTS applications.

    abstract = "{Short-read accuracy is important for downstream analyses such as genome assembly and hybrid long-read correction. Despite much work on short-read correction, present-day correctors either do not scale well on large datasets or consider reads as mere suites of k-mers, without taking into account their full-length read information.We propose a new method to correct short reads using de Bruijn graphs and implement it as a tool called Bcool. As a first step, Bcool constructs a compacted de Bruijn graph from the reads. This graph is filtered on the basis of k-mer abundance then of unitig abundance, thereby removing most sequencing errors. The cleaned graph is then used as a reference on which the reads are mapped to correct them. We show that this approach yields more accurate reads than k-mer-spectrum correctors while being scalable to human-size genomic datasets and beyond.The implementation is open source, available at http://github.com/Malfoy/BCOOL under the Affero GPL license and as a Bioconda package.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

	abstract = {Aligning DNA sequences to an annotated reference is a key step for genotyping in biology. Recent scientific studies have demonstrated improved inference by aligning reads to a variation graph, \ie, a reference sequence augmented with known genetic variations. Given a variation graph in the form of a directed acyclic string graph, the sequence to graph alignment problem seeks to find the best matching path in the graph for an input query sequence. Solving this problem exactly using a sequential dynamic programming algorithm takes quadratic time in terms of the graph size and query length, making it difficult to scale to high throughput DNA sequencing data. In this work, we propose the first parallel algorithm for computing sequence to graph alignments that leverages multiple cores and single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. We take advantage of the available inter-task parallelism, and provide a novel blocked approach to compute the score matrix while ensuring high memory locality. Using a 48-core Intel Xeon Skylake processor, the proposed algorithm achieves peak performance of 317 billion cell updates per second (GCUPS), and demonstrates near linear weak and strong scaling on up to 48 cores. It delivers significant performance gains compared to existing algorithms, and results in run-time reduction from multiple days to three hours for the problem of optimally aligning high coverage long (PacBio/ONT) or short (Illumina) DNA reads to an MHC human variation graph containing 10 million vertices.},

However, these approaches require high coverage by long reads and remain expensive. On the other hand, the inexpensive short reads technologies produce accurate but fragmented assemblies. Thus, a hybrid approach that assembles long reads (with low coverage) and short reads has a potential to generate high-quality assemblies at reduced cost.
RESULTS: We describe hybridSPAdes algorithm for assembling short and long reads and benchmark it on a variety of bacterial assembly projects. Our results demonstrate that hybridSPAdes generates accurate assemblies (even in projects with relatively low coverage by long reads) thus reducing the overall cost of genome sequencing. We further present the first complete assembly of a genome from single cells using SMRT reads.

	abstract = {Exact pattern matching in labeled graphs is the problem of searching paths of a graph \$G=(V,E)\$ that spell the same string as the pattern \$P[1..m]\$. This basic problem can be found at the heart of more complex operations on variation graphs in computational biology, of query operations in graph databases, and of analysis operations in heterogeneous networks, where the nodes of some paths must match a sequence of labels or types. We describe a simple conditional lower bound that, for any constant \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textgreater}0\$, an \$O({\textbar}E{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon\} {\textbackslash}, m)\$-time or an \$O({\textbar}E{\textbar} {\textbackslash}, m{\textasciicircum}\{1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon\})\$-time algorithm for exact pattern matching on graphs, with node labels and patterns drawn from a binary alphabet, cannot be achieved unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false. The result holds even if restricted to undirected graphs of maximum degree three or directed acyclic graphs of maximum sum of indegree and outdegree three. Although a conditional lower bound of this kind can be somehow derived from previous results (Backurs and Indyk, FOCS'16), we give a direct reduction from SETH for dissemination purposes, as the result might interest researchers from several areas, such as computational biology, graph database, and graph mining, as mentioned before. Indeed, as approximate pattern matching on graphs can be solved in \$O({\textbar}E{\textbar}{\textbackslash},m)\$ time, exact and approximate matching are thus equally hard (quadratic time) on graphs under the SETH assumption. In comparison, the same problems restricted to strings have linear time vs quadratic time solutions, respectively, where the latter ones have a matching SETH lower bound on computing the edit distance of two strings (Backurs and Indyk, STOC'15).},

However, some of these technologies produce very short reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a diploid genome, \eg, from a human sample. MAQ makes full use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and user-friendly. It is freely available at http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

It is 3-4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ‚â•30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.

However, these techniques are known to be problematic when applied to highly polymorphic genomic regions, such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Because accurate genotype calls and allele frequency estimations are crucial to population genomics analyses, it is important to assess the reliability of NGS data. Here, we evaluate the reliability of genotype calls and allele frequency estimates of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported by 1000G (phase I) at five HLA genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1). We take advantage of the availability of HLA Sanger sequencing of 930 of the 1092 1000G samples and use this as a gold standard to benchmark the 1000G data. We document that 18.6\% of SNP genotype calls in HLA genes are incorrect and that allele frequencies are estimated with an error greater than ¬±0.1 at approximately 25\% of the SNPs in HLA genes. We found a bias toward overestimation of reference allele frequency for the 1000G data, indicating mapping bias is an important cause of error in frequency estimation in this dataset. We provide a list of sites that have poor allele frequency estimates and discuss the outcomes of including those sites in different kinds of analyses. Because the HLA region is the most polymorphic in the human genome, our results provide insights into the challenges of using of NGS data at other genomic regions of high diversity.},

Mapping of short reads on long reads provides sufficient coverage to eliminate up to 99\% of errors, however, at the expense of prohibitive running times and considerable amounts of disk and memory space.
RESULTS: We present LoRDEC, a hybrid error correction method that builds a succinct de Bruijn graph representing the short reads, and seeks a corrective sequence for each erroneous region in the long reads by traversing chosen paths in the graph. In comparison, LoRDEC is at least six times faster and requires at least 93\% less memory or disk space than available tools, while achieving comparable accuracy.

	abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals., Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows‚ÄìWheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, \eg from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ‚àº10‚Äì20√ó faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format.

	abstract = {Molecular differences between HLA alleles vary up to 57 nucleotides within the peptide binding coding region of human Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes, but it is still unclear whether this variation results from a stochastic process or from selective constraints related to functional differences among HLA molecules. Although HLA alleles are generally treated as equidistant molecular units in population genetic studies, DNA sequence diversity among populations is also crucial to interpret the observed HLA polymorphism. In this study, we used a large dataset of 2,062 DNA sequences defined for the different HLA alleles to analyze nucleotide diversity of seven HLA genes in 23,500 individuals of about 200 populations spread worldwide. We first analyzed the HLA molecular structure and diversity of these populations in relation to geographic variation and we further investigated possible departures from selective neutrality through Tajima's tests and mismatch distributions. All results were compared to those obtained by classical approaches applied to HLA allele frequencies.Our study shows that the global patterns of HLA nucleotide diversity among populations are significantly correlated to geography, although in some specific cases the molecular information reveals unexpected genetic relationships. At all loci except HLA-DPB1, populations have accumulated a high proportion of very divergent alleles, suggesting an advantage of heterozygotes expressing molecularly distant HLA molecules (asymmetric overdominant selection model). However, both different intensities of selection and unequal levels of gene conversion may explain the heterogeneous mismatch distributions observed among the loci. Also, distinctive patterns of sequence divergence observed at the HLA-DPB1 locus suggest current neutrality but old selective pressures on this gene. We conclude that HLA DNA sequences advantageously complement HLA allele frequencies as a source of data used to explore the genetic history of human populations, and that their analysis allows a more thorough investigation of human MHC molecular evolution.},
