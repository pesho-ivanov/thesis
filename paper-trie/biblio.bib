 comment = {Tool: Introducing the VG framework. The current version of vg uses heuristics in place of a true probability model for its mapped reads. We expect that true generalizations of traditional models will be a significant advancement for the field, particularly for segregating structural variants. The leading linear reference-based variant calling tools in use today are all based on probabilistic models of sequencing data (Nielsen et al. 2011). This approach has several advantages. Modern sequencing technologies all attempt to quantify the uncertainty in their base calls. Probability models provide a natural framework to incorporate this uncertainty into genotype calls, and they allow algorithms to estimate uncertainty about genotype calls for downstream analyses},

 comment = {Guarantees: Quantifying mapping quality. The consensus sequence is inferred from a Bayesian statistical model, and each consensus genotype is associated with a phred quality that measures the probability that the consensus genotype is incorrect. On the assumption that sequencing errors are independent at different sites of the read, the probability p(z|x,u) of z coming from the position u equals the product of the error probabilities of the mismatched bases at the aligned position. The reliability of read alignments can substantially affect the accuracy of the detection of variations. Knowing which alignment is reliable is key to the subsequent analyses. The most convenient way to measure the reliability is to define uniqueness: A read is said to be uniquely mapped if its second best hit contains more mismatches than its best hit.},
