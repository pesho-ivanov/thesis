Possible contributions:
- (quant) transition probs
- (quant) different edit penalties in different reference parts (different edits for diff. nucleotides)
- (qual) separating the differnet scores: edits, phreds, ...
- (qual) solving the exact task
- (qual) guarantees using the other alignments


On the problem statement:
- genome inference task?
- complete genomes model: only introducing small-scale variation; whereas the core genomes model introduces both small and large scale
- small-scale variation is independent of the occurance frequency
- model of `reality' sounds weird
- `s' in the complete genomes model to be fixed not to be >L characters
- phred values are log-normalized probabilities
- `edit' -> `substitute'/`substitution'
- remove the 0.7, 0.1, ... probabilities from Listing 1
- use `error' in the context of sequencing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score

%Phylogenetic Quantification of Intra-tumour Heterogeneity (2014) – highly cited. “Additionally, it would certainly be desirable to move from the current minimum-evolution approach to a full probabilistic model with specific probabilities for amplification and deletion events. Event probabilities could then be trained by expectation-maximisation. However, this significantly increases the computational complexity of the algorithm, which demands the development of new heuristics that constrain the size of intermediate results of the reconstruction process.”
%``the HMM does not model insertion/deletion mutations within gene segments at this time. Their inclusion would impose a significant computational burden: rather than a linear number of transitions there would be a quadratic number''
%``While the choice of a geometric distribution is simply a result of HMMs’ inherent lack of memory, in practice we observe that Nregion lengths are not far from geometrically distributed (Fig 4).''
%``Such events [insertion/deletion], [...], could in principle be incorporated into an HMM with additional transitions between the states representing insertions and deletions within the HMM, although significant innovation would be needed in order to keep annotation inference tractable.''
%``However, because partis fits parameters on the fly for each data set, it never makes out-of-sample predictions and thus does not “train” in this sense. This is not to say that the approach would not benefit from some form of acrosssample estimation of parameters.''

%A practical algorithm for finding maximal exact matches in large sequence datasets using sparse suffix arrays (2009) – “MEMs are exact matches between two sequences that cannot be extended in either direction toward the end or the beginning of the sequences without introducing a mismatch (Abouelhoda et al., 2006; Kurtz et al., 2004). The only constraint on MEMs is a minimum length L. Without this constraint, a large number of matches consisting of a small number of characters will be returned. To find MEMs between a query string P and the reference string S, the algorithm advances through each character position p in the query string and attempts to find MEMs of sufficient length that begin at p in the query string.”
