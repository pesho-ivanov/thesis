\section{\astarix: Finding Optimal Alignments Using \A} \label{sec:astarix-algo}
In this section, we first introduce the general \A algorithm for finding
shortest paths, and the notion of an optimistic heuristic, a sufficient
condition for instantiations of \A to be correct (i.e., to indeed find shortest
paths). Then we instantiate \A with our domain-specific heuristic that accounts
for upcoming subsequences to be aligned, and prove that this heuristic is
optimistic.
