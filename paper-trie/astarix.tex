\section{Finding optimal alignments using \A} \label{TRIEsec:astarix-algo}

In this section, we first introduce the general \A algorithm for finding
shortest paths, and the notion of an admissible heuristic, a sufficient
condition for instantiations of \A to be correct (\ie, to indeed find shortest
paths). Then we instantiate \A with our domain-specific heuristic that accounts
for upcoming subsequences to be aligned, and prove that this heuristic is
admissible.
