% Summary.
We presented \astarix, an \A algorithm to find optimal alignments, based on a
domain-specific heuristic and enhanced by multiple algorithmic optimizations.
Importantly, our approach allows for both cyclic and acyclic graphs including
variation and de Bruijn graphs.

We demonstrated that \astarix scales exponentially better than \dijkstra with
increasing (but small) number of errors in the reads. Moreover, for short reads,
both \astarix and \dijkstra scale better and outperform current state-of-the-art
optimal aligners with increasing genome graph size. Nevertheless, scaling
optimal alignment of long reads on big graphs remains an open problem.
